We can refer a stand-alone paragraph as **miniature essay**. It is not a part of an essay. Instead, it possess the characteristics of an essay. For example, it has a clear beginning, a middle and an end. 
### Characteristics
- Because it is so much shorter than an essay, it must get to the point faster.  Usually, a stand alone paragraph begins with a topic sentence that expresses its main point. 
- Because the stand-alone paragraph appears by itself, it needs a conclusion.  Usually the concluding sentence sums up the paragraph's main point.


Though it may look like "stand-alone paragraphs" can't be used in essays, that's not correct. If we can manage to write a good and standard "stand-alone paragraph" following the [[202107011113_Paragraphing_Building  one | standard practice]] we can place it between two other paragraphs in an [[202106282240_Essay | essay]]. But as we have to abide by the [[202106291413_Paragraphing_Pattern of Organization | pattern of organization]] and maintain the [[202106291429_Paragraphing_Coherent Paragraphing | coherency]] between paragraphs, **all you have to do is manipulate the conclusion sentence of the paragraph so that it transitions into the topic sentence of the paragraph that follows it.** ^c3af59


### A stand-alone paragraph about "Profile of a person"
>  **Paul Norman has loved airplanes all his life.  Even when he was a little boy, he wanted to be a pilot.  He used to draw airplanes on all his schoolwork.  He also folded paper airplanes and designed new folding techniques so the planes would fly in certain ways.  In high school and college he studied subjects that would help him become a pilot.  He took every geography and math course his high school offered, and in college he took physics and aerodynamics as well as advanced math.  Unfortunately, Paul's vision was not acute enough for him to qualify as a professional or a military pilot, so he tried another way of working with planes.  He went back to school and earned a master's degree in business administration; now he is the manager of a major airport in Houston.  From child to adult Paul has not changed his major interest--airplanes.**
