The topic sentence of your paragraph will introduce the main point and focus of the individual paragraph( or [[202107011126_Paragraphing_Stand-alone Paragraph| stand-alone paragraph]] ). In other words, it expresses what the paragraph is about. 
-   The **topic** of the paragraph
-   The **central point** of the paragraph.
After the topic sentence, you expand on the point with evidence and examples.

Most of the time, it is necessary to make transition smoothly from one paragraph to another in an [[202106282240_Essay | essay]], that is to switch from one point to another point. Topic sentences can make some dramatic changes in this "transition" as we can show connections to the previous one through them. 

### Contexts
#### Where does topic sentence go? 
> The topic sentence usually goes at the very start of a paragraph, but sometimes it can come later to indicate a change of direction in the paragraph’s argument.

Putting topic sentences at the very start of paragraph is vastly followed as it makes the structure more focused and concise. 
#### Writing topic sentences
> Though these following steps are written considering essay, they could be followed for stand-alone paragraph. We have to just regard the paragraph itself as a miniature essay. 
1. **A thesis statement**
	A strong thesis statement points out the main idea of an essay and based on this idea, we sit to build the paragraphs to support it. Hence, it is necessary that we have a thesis statement before writing topic sentences. 
2. **Make an essay outline and draft topic sentences**
	Next we should make an outline of our essay's structure, planning what we want to say in each paragraph and what evidence and example we'll use. 
	Now as we know what are going to say on each paragraph, we should draft a topic sentence that gives us a concise idea and perception about the whole paragraph or the key things we are going to say. 
	This topic sentence should be related to the thesis statement. 
3. **Expand the sentence with evidence and example** 
	Every topic sentence expresses just an opinion that we provide after analyzing the thesis statement. But after that, we have to provide evidence and example that will strengthen our opinion throughout the [[202107011842_Paragraphing_Body of a paragraph | body of the paragraph]]. 
4. **Refining topic sentences**
	We have used only the first version of our topic sentences. But it is temporary. As our essay or thesis will grow, the quality and accuracy of topic sentences will grow. 
	> A good topic sentence is specific enough to give a clear sense of what to expect from the paragraph, but general enough that it doesn’t give everything away. We can think of it like a signpost: it should tell the reader which direction our argument is going in.
	
	So it is good practice to come back to revise the topic sentences and their contexts to make it more precise according to the main idea of the paragraph.
