A good essay begins with an opinion of the author on the subject at hand - his/her thesis. Honestly, the author of an essay just gives his opinions on a particular subject and accumulate or display some worth evidence and examples to support them. 
The success of an essay depends on how the presented or given evidence support the author's opinions. Therefore, we should carefully choose evidence. But sometimes too much evidence creates the redundancy feeling among the readers as it is detrimental to the development of the essay. 
However too much opinions can also be balanced with strong evidence. So balance between evidence and opinion is crucial to the development. 
> In an academic essay, although your opinion may have been influenced by the research conducted, one should refrain from making assertions without presenting clear evidence to fortify it.
